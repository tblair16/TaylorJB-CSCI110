Final Project: Hangman
The goal of my project is to create an interactive hangman game. The theme of hangman is zoo animals. I created a file with a list of words, and then created a function that randomly selects one of the words. From there, guesses can be made and my code will test to see if the letter exists within the random word. If it does not, then a mistake is recorded and hangman begins to be built. After each round, the user is prompted with whether to keep playing or leave the game. Additionally, my code will read from a file to select a word, and then will write the results in an additional file, recording the number of incorrect and correct guesses. 



My final project is done at of 04/05/2025
