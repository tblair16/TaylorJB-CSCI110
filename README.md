Final Project: Hangman
The goal of my project is to create an interactive hangman game. I created a file with a list of words, and then created a function that randomly selects one of the words. From there, guesses can be made and my code will test to see if the letter exists within the random word. If it does not, then a mistake is recorded and hangman begins to be built using an conditionals. Additionally, there will be a button to leave the game. 

Things I need to do:
-Figure out to set amount of guesses
-Use an outfile
-Debugg


The project is not done as of 03/15/2025.
